nejlpxj,Spirited_Drawing2403,datascience,"Hi, i have a question. I'm 23, i will soon graduate with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and while studying i developed Aureus, a predictive AI system designed for American football. Unlike traditional models, my model combines expert priors, memory of past errors, feature re-weighting, and uncertainty estimation to mimic human reasoning while leveraging machine learning at scale. Based on what i've found on the internet, Aureus became the first documented pre-game NFL model to surpass 70% accuracy across a full season.

nef2cmk,br0monium,datascience,"Your first point about soft skills and persuasion is important. Some DS roles might look like being a sql monkey at a first glance, but the expectation is that you are reaching out to analysts to understand niche data, talking to SMEs to scope business problems independently, and influencing all along the way ensure you're building an effective solution that gets widely adopted or changes decisions.   Operational tasks look very different because you don't have to get your hands dirty with DIYing the data infra or the MLOps. But you spend a lot more time thinking about data quality, speed of pipelines, finding and assessing business problems without guidance, and integrating solutions or influencing decisions.   In terms of textbook definitions or STAR interview answers, it *can be* a lot more data science-y than roles that seem technically more involved.

neevmlb,br0monium,datascience,"Up until recently, I would say the DS role varied a lot. A lot of times, big parts of the DS team were essentially internal consultants. They might do a lot of statistical theory, predictive analytics, ML modeling etc for stakeholders, but they might also focus on verifying things or taking over ownership of analysis-heavy processes or statistical/ML models. While building models was trivial, the standards for MLOps were really high, so DS was often the only team with the appropriate scope to maintain the model and it's data pipeline while being accountable for deployment. The emphasis on scope in all role expectations meant that over time, things would move towards owning important data assets, building frameworks or intake processes, and being accountable for the veracity of anything reported to leadership.      The ""up-or-out"" standard paired with the layoffs and a big push to use internal LLMs or machine tools probably pushed this more towards what you are describing. I wouldn't be surprised if most of the demand is focused on GTM functions that still require DoE or tailored approaches. All the supporting functions might be relegated to teams focused on building ""AI-tools"" since either the XFN have been axed or the C-Suite changed the expectations to focus on shipping AI stuff as opposed to generating impact for stakeholders.      The current state of things is just my best guess, but I think the real point is that it's in flux. Lots of downsizing DS functions since 2023, and all investment shifted towards foundational models and ""AI"" tooling. Any status quo is relatively new and untested. If the bets on AI pay off, we might see more DS roles supporting internal tools or actual AI products. If AI products don't show revenue GROWTH or continued productivity gains... it's anyone's guess. If a new source of revenue growth saves the day, it all depends on how it benefits from DS or ""AI.""

At the very least I'd imagine that your Marketing Spend has some component of seasonality to it, or would be driven by economic trends.

There's just too much you can't control for to reliably believe you've found an appropriate (yet sufficiently strong) instrument. Plus even if you have you're estimating the Local Average Treatment Effect, not the Average Treatment Effect.   Generally your question is just very difficult to answer. As you'd expect for a platform the users and advertisers are very intimately linked. Depending on your data some things I'd consider:  - Do you guys do staggered roll-outs for product feature? If you think these improve user acquisition you can try using the presence of the feature as an instrument, though of course I'm sure these aren't rolled out randomly - Depending on your data size you can explore panel data fixed effects methods. Run a regression of the difference in spend per advertiser in a certain region over the difference in user growth for a region. Add a bunch of fixed effects (region, year, seasonal, sector, etc.) and as many controls as you can - Leverage other research to answer your question. There's a huge literature on Network Economics.

nedlfde,Money-Commission9304,datascience,"Great comment and you've really gotten to the heart of the problem I am facing. I've already proven and done the work on stage 1 which is:  * Marketing spend -> Increases user acquisition and retention -> Leads to higher Monthly Active Users (MAUs).   I have geo experiments running for each marketing channel and an MMM. So I know what's working and what's not and I'm at a point where marketing spend is very well optimized to ensure we are getting users in from channels that minimize are CAC but also maximize LTV as much as possible.   The issue is that, like you pointed out, I do believe that there are advertisers who see our ads that we are running and I do believe some of them get converted or resurrected as a result of these ads. That being said, our ads are purely catered (in terms of creative and delivery) towards acquiring users not towards advertisers. So I think proving marketing/ad spend -> Ad Revenue directly is probably not possible just because that effect is probably so small.   And also, there is a huge lagged effect from seeing an ad to then wanting to advertise on the platform. Somewhere in the range of 3-12 months.   Which is why I am framing the question a bit differently.   Like I said, I know the answer to question 1 - which is how many users do we acquire as a result of spending money on marketing.   Since our user base is growing significantly because of that marketing spend, advertisers will probably spend more money and place more ads on our platform because we are growing. So the company's growth in advertiser revenue is in part due to our ability to grow as a platform (in addition to better ads relevance models, seasonality etc etc).   So what I am trying to do through the 2SLS is model, for each user that marketing spend acquires what is the incremental advertiser revenue generated by those users.   If I just look at a plot of users on the x axis and ads revenue on the y axis, it increases pretty much linearly.   I can probably lag advertiser revenue in the 2SLS as well to account for the lagged effect.   But I am trying to figure out if my thinking above is correct. Is it fair to use an instrumental variable approach here?",1757956308.0
nediaaq,Ragefororder1846,datascience,"Thinking about your causal chain a bit and this seems like it would be a tricky problem to solve. You buy ads in time t which are shown to people who then get on your platform and increase your MAUs for time t+1, t+2, t+3, etc. This is then observed by other businesses who choose to buy more ads on your platform at time t+2. However, you're still buying ads during time t+1, t+2, and so on. I think this is a case where you'd be better off proving Part 1 and Part 2 separately because trying to go straight from higher ad spend -> more ad revenue has what I would guess are long and variable lags  Edit: saw your comment below where you said that you solved Part 1 already. Okay then. I think that you may still have a lag problem going from higher MAUs to higher ad spend (Are all your advertisers doing ad buys in real time or even every month? Somehow I doubt it). Another issue is that advertisers are choosing between a number of different platforms to place ads. Anything that increases your MAUs that also increases the MAUs of all your other competitors won't have an effect, so you shouldn't use a sectoral variable as your instrument. It's hard to say without knowing exactly what your business is.",1757955415.0

Also the p value on the Durbin-Wu-Hausman is less than 0.05.",1757954473.0
nede2z0,Money-Commission9304,datascience,I know the impact of marketing on MAUs. Because we do have experiments etc going. We drive a lot of user growth through marketing.   What I am trying to answer is how does that user growth then translate to advertiser revenue growth.   Advertisers pay our platform to place ads. My thought process is that if our MAUs weren't growing our revenue from advertisers would not grow as much as it has because why would advertisers pay more to advertise on a platform where the user base is not growing?   I know the answer to this stage:   Stage 1: Marketing spend -> Increases user acquisition and retention -> Leads to higher Monthly Active Users (MAUs).  What i am trying to figure out is if it fair to use a 2SLS to answer the second stage:   Stage 2: Higher MAUs -> Makes our platform more attractive to advertisers -> Leads to more advertisers and higher ad revenue.,1757954192.0
nedcbzc,Unlikely-Lime-1336,datascience,"so this is going to sound like a slightly circular question but do the marketing spend you put in come with some results? as in, at your business, does the marketing have any A/B testing embedded - because that might give you a real answer on the impact of marketing on MAUs, my guess is once you know the link between those 2, the ad revenue will be very directly correlated with the MAUs in a way in which both you and the advertisers understand - but maybe there's some key information I'm missing on your business",1757953671.0

Both methods rely on the continuation of past statistical relationships and distributions into the present but this is a dangerous assumption with macroeconomic data. This is because macroeconomic data is influenced by people who can also see these past relationships (typically central banks).   Consider the relationship between inflation and unemployment (the so-called Phillips Curve). In the past (the 1950s-1960s) it was assumed that these variables had a relatively fixed relationship. Inflation goes up, unemployment goes down. Inflation goes down, unemployment goes up. Therefore, it was widely believed by economists that you could decrease unemployment by increasing inflation. So economists tried that and it didn't work. The Phillips Curve broke and there was both high inflation and high unemployment at the same time. The problem was that the Phillips Curve's validity was reliant upon the decisions made by policymakers *before* they knew the Phillips Curve existed. Once they gained new ""knowledge"" of the economy, they changed how they made their decisions which in turn changed the underlying relationship.   This is known in economics as the Lucas Critique.

ne0muvu,pdashk,datascience,"First, let me commend you for actively pursuing better solutions in a space that you may not fully understand. This embodies the spirit of what it meant to do data science when the field started. That said, I think this post is riddled with misconceptions that make it difficult to follow, but let me try my best to provide some productive dialogue.   What you are describing is not a database, but rather file or object storage. The data is also not tree structured, it is unstructured. The directory structure itself is also not technically tree structured because projects can share studies, whereas tree branches do not share leaves.   So if I am understanding this right, you have something like SharePoint, Google drive, Dropbox, or other network drive that you would like to search through using a tool or programming library. In this case, searches do not traditionally parse through the files themselves, but rather metadata on the files/folders that you must create and maintain, like creating a catalog or tagging all of your data. Since your studies are shared by projects and there are not many categories, you might consider abandoning the hierarchy (you call tree) altogether and just have studies all in one flat directory but tag each study with a project, category, and related studies.   If you really care about the relationships of the studies and projects, you can create a small graph database to link the studies, and you can do complex searches, such as ""how many studies do I have that have at least 2 child studies"". But to be clear, this is just a metadata layer on top of your folder structure and not looking at the data files you've stored.   I said above that search does not traditionally parse through files but modern platforms and LLM-based approaches do. This is relatively new, not yet very reliable, and not something an individual can really implement in a meaningful way. The big platforms like SharePoint and Google drive are all moving this way and will probably soon have advanced capabilities to do what you are describing.   Lastly, I would be remiss if I did not mention that scripts, data frames, and pptx all living in one directory is generally bad practice unless you are zipping away for archive.

I sent him some of my work which included a 23 page writeup on my optimization engine as well as my GitHub repo, and he was super enthusiastic and said I seemed like an uncanny fit for his team. We kept up a correspondence throughout the whole interview process, but then once I got through all 3 interview rounds, which each went super well, I waited around for two weeks to hear anything back and all I got was a cold rejection email from the recruiter. I reached out to the hiring manager just thanking him for his time and letting him know I applied to a couple other DS roles they have open, one of which is also on his team, but he never got back to me.

Yes the DS role at meta is heavily focused on product analytics which involves A/B testing and influencing decision for the business instead of building models. This is usually viewed as ""not sexy"" from a pure technical or ML perspective, but in reality the job is more than just SQL and require strong soft skills and persuasion. The L5 Meta DS pay is also quite high within the industry. Most META DS still at least have a MS.       On the other end, MLE at Meta are mostly worrying about ML model building, feature stores, scaling, and deployment. It's a lot of data plumbing not so much math heavy. Unless you're reinventing a new algorithm like at OpenAI, most of the ""math"" is just model.fit(x,y), bulding the data pipeline takes the most time. (i.e how do we get feature x1,x2 from this service to prediction in real time). Some DS to end up becoming MLE's or they were just SWE's.   For other FAANG adjacent companies the split is a bit less clear cut depending on resourcing and teams. For example Uber/Lyft has decision science (product analytics), research science (what people think DS is), and MLE (engineers working on ML model). In practice, DS may do some prototyping for ML and define business requirements for the model, and the hand it off to MLE to scale the model and deploy.",1757701721.0

And having competent management and executives made people want to stay, even if they weren't making the best money.   I actually managed technical training and we either sent off people to get specialized degrees (at times allowing them to work part time while keeping their full time salaries) or brought in vendors to offer training on tools and software just as a project was starting to take off.  I would even tap folks in academia to teach if it was a topic that was cutting edge.  Our engineers were damn good and they were smart enough to know what they didn't know.  Even something as basic as Microsoft Office training for administrators and support staff was so beneficial and taught valuable skills that could be applied immediately.  Unfortunately, shareholder greed and corporate culture only cares about short term goals like boosting profits and cutting costs.  And training is always the first thing to get cut.",1757658339.0

ndq7h9e,br0monium,datascience,"I worked at Meta for 5 years, and I interviewed quite a few people. If you worked there more recently and were involved in hiring decisions, I'll take your word for it. Otherwise, I think you are just nitpicking exceptions.    SWEs all have to go through boot camp, so yes, it's possible they arent placed upon a hiring decision. Back when they were growing a ton, SWEs may have been hired on without a team, and many wouldnt commit to a team until finishing bootcamp. The scenario where this might happen for other roles is ""impact hiring"" when building a new department or growing an organization really fast.    There still needs to be a POC for the recruiter, and I don't think this is differentiated from ""hiring manager"" on the backend.    If you have a ton of candidates coming through a pipeline like this, you still need to batch them. It takes 4-6 manhours of interviews plus write-ups per candidate. Interviewers are all tenured FTEs at the company; noone wants to be interviewing people perpetually. If you are trying to fill a role for your team, then you want to backfill any lost headcount by the end of the quarter and you want to hire any new headcount before roadmapping. You also dont want 4 of the experienced ICs on your team constantly conducting interviews.    The interviewer training is pretty clear about trying to discuss candidates all at once, or close together, in a structured environment to reduce bias. So you would still want to batch candidates when hiring a pool of bootcampers to ensure that the people who actually interviewed all the candidates are available to discuss them.   I never saw any indication in interviewer training that candidate discussions are skipped for continuous pipelines or impact hiring. If interviewers could just submit their choices directly to the recruiter in these cases, that's the only scenario I can think of where deliberation would impact the wait time for a decision. I only see this working if the recruiter is given whole sale authority to, for example, extend X offers per quarter if all the interviewers said ""hire"" or ""strong hire"" for the candidate.  I never interviewed people for impact hiring or for going into a pool, but I find it a lot more likely that there is still a ""hiring manager"" that gathers everything together and tells the recruiter, ""We recommend these 3 candidates out of the 12 we interviewed last week.""   Still, anyone who has been an interviewer at the company can tell you that you need to write up your assessment ASAP because its really hard to remember details after interviewing even a couple candidates in between your normal responsibilities. If youre going to reject or hire a candidate, you make that decision pretty quickly after interviewing or during the meeting to discuss candidates. An extended search for a qualified candidate or a continous pipeline would really only affect whether you could schedule your interview 12 weeks out versus 4 weeks out. Once you interview, all of the interviewers want to get the paperwork off of their desk ASAP, so they can fill the role or go back to working on stuff that will actually impact their PSCs.",1757634853.0

It always has been an energy drainer for me - I find I'm putting on a front.  You might benefit from different management. There's always some degree of ""selling"" your work in the corporate world, but it varies a lot depending on the workplace culture. In some (rare) organizations it's not prevalent at all; management is very bought-in, so you show the hard numbers and they accept your suggestions. More commonly, your senior management can handle this, either while the project is being initiated/funded or once you've shared your results with them.  I have a two strategies to minimize the amount of time I spend ""selling"":  * Build up trust with a group of stakeholders by working on multiple projects with them. You'll usually only sell your work the first time when they're not familiar with your work. * Don't make lots of different presentations.

There's just nowhere to catch it once it's escaped the method because a finalization is already outside the normal flow of control. Usually, this is OK because the object was about to be destroyed anyway. At worst, you get a resource leak, but the rest of the program will still behave correctly.  If you want to force termination (""panic"") rather than continue with a warning, you can still quit with `import os; os._exit(1)` from a finalizer. Put the whole body in a `try` statement and quit if there are any exceptions you don't care to handle immediately. The only way this fails (assuming you didn't write the code wrong) is if the `os` module has been deleted, which usually means the system is in the process of terminating anyway. And, of course, because this quits immediately, this prevents any other finalizers from running at all.  [Edit: Don't forget to print a traceback or something before calling `os._exit(1)`, or you may have no idea why your program failed. You could also use an exit code different than 1 to convey additional information, although that's a reasonable default if you don't have a better idea.

So one use case I had was writing a parser combinator. Meaning it‚Äôs a parser that can combine multiple other parsers and they can be composed in however way I want.   By using generics and defining the input and defining the inputs and outputs of each parser, I can easily combine them based on what I need to parse, and at the end I can see the type of the final output. And I don‚Äôt need to wait to run before being able to know if I combined the parsers correctly.  You can get the same type of feedback if you use a library like Angstrom for Ocaml. I wrote a json parser with it, and whenever I wanted to parse a complex expression, the LSP would be screaming at me the whole time while I was writing the code and figuring out how I want to parse a json object, and the moment I wrote the final piece the LSP was accepting the code, and running it made it work exactly like I expected it to.

If you *do* end up passing strings to a numerical operator, you get the same error anyway because as you say, it doesn‚Äôt affect how the code runs. In the case of bad ingest, you probably want to try casting to a numeric value before raising the exception (or reject the row, log it, and continue).   I understand type checking for large teams (as pseudo-documentation). But this kind of example puzzles me a bit, because it‚Äôs not something I see in code I work with.

nedqs9n,boss5667,Python,"I asked the same question to Claude recently.  Here is the response;  Companies use several technical and legal strategies to protect their on-premises software from unauthorized modifications:  **Technical Protection Methods:**  **Code Obfuscation and Compilation** - Companies distribute compiled binaries rather than source code, making reverse engineering significantly more difficult. Code obfuscation techniques further scramble the logic to make it nearly impossible to understand even if decompiled.  **License Key Validation** - Software includes licensing systems that validate against encrypted keys or online activation servers. The software won‚Äôt function without proper validation, and these systems are often deeply integrated into core functionality.  **Digital Signatures and Integrity Checks** - Executables are digitally signed, and the software performs runtime integrity checks. Any modification breaks these signatures, causing the software to refuse to run or enter a limited mode.  **Anti-Tampering Technologies** - Advanced protection includes runtime application self-protection (RASP), which monitors for debugging attempts, memory manipulation, or other signs of tampering and shuts down if detected.  **Encrypted Communication** - Critical components often communicate through encrypted channels with validation servers, making it difficult to intercept or modify data flows.  **Legal Protections:**  **End User License Agreements (EULAs)** explicitly prohibit reverse engineering, modification, or redistribution. While technical savvy users might still attempt modifications, this provides legal recourse.  **Regular audits and compliance checks** are often built into enterprise contracts, giving vendors the right to verify proper software usage.  **Hybrid Approaches:**  Many companies now offer ‚Äúon-premises‚Äù solutions that are actually containerized applications with encrypted, regularly updated components that maintain some connection to vendor servers for validation and updates.  While determined attackers can potentially circumvent these protections, the goal is making modification so difficult and legally risky that it‚Äôs not practical for most organizations, who typically prefer supported, compliant software installations.‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã",1757957822.0

Creating such an interactive and lightweight LLM-driven experience in a terminal is a unique approach‚Äîit feels like combining Python development, gaming, and AI exploration into one dynamic package.

The JSON state export/resume feature is another strength‚Äîit‚Äôs a great touch for debugging, sharing, and enhancing collaboration.

JSON is simpler and safer, but can be hard to read or edit manually.  For something that's both Python-friendly and human-friendly, **TOML** is a great middle ground. It‚Äôs increasingly the standard in the Python ecosystem (see `pyproject.toml`), supports clear nesting, and works well with non-technical teams editing configs.  That said, if your configs are used only within Python and you want max speed and minimal translation logic, you can even use Python itself (as a `.py` file or via `ast.literal_eval()`), though that's less common in larger applications.  tl;dr:  * **JSON** if simplicity and cross-language use are top priorities. * **TOML** if humans will edit the files often. * **YAML** only if you really need advanced features like anchors (but be careful with parsing). * **Python dicts or Pickle** only if the data stays 100% inside your Python app.  If your team already knows Python, TOML is likely your best bet.",1757931743.0

But it's not that great, even for teaching: you can teach numerical methods with numpy, using numpy for storing vectors, arrays an doing BLAS-like stuff. And that will teach you numpy as well, a standard package nowadays, you will have code that is reasonably fast and reusable for serious tasks.  It's how numerical methods were taught in the 2000s: not with numpy of course, but with a ""matrix language"" like Matlab, Octave or Scilab. Numpy replaces those, but pure Python does not.  It won't be a good reference for implementing either, because pure Python misses all important effects.

neaby64,Gnaxe,Python,"YAML is not a sane language, and everyone should stop using it. It's also a superset of JSON, so anything that requires YAML will accept JSON instead. This means that it is in no way simpler, faster, or easier to understand. It's arcane and overcomplex. If the choice is between YAML and JSON, the answer is *always* JSON.  Python's standard library can parse Python literal notation with `ast.literal_eval()`, and output it just with `repr()`, assuming you're only using the supported types. This is a little bit more powerful than JSON, allowing things like comments, sets, and complex numbers. If you're only communicating with Python, this is a format you should seriously consider.  Python can also parse and output JSON and that's also included in the standard library. If you need to communicate over a network with servers written in different languages, JSON is much more widely supported. If pure JSON is inadequate for complicated config files (you really need anchors/references or extend and comments) then you're better off writing a simple Python script to output the JSON. It will be more powerful *and* clearer than YAML.  For configuration files, TOML is considered more standard than YAML in Python. The standard library can also parse TOML. It can't output it, however; they're meant to be written by hand. (Of course, Python can write arbitrary text files, and the format is simple enough that you could construct simple examples without much more than `print()`.)",1757906399.0

ne6tu4n,sciencenerd_1943,Python,I don‚Äôt think so. SymPy should focus primarily on providing good symbolic methods for expressions. Anything more would be bloat in my opinion. The same goes for SciPy. The purpose of MathFlow is it bridge these two awesome tools and add some extra features for ease of use. It should be entirely optional and natural to switch between MathFlow and normal SciPy/SymPy. One should not replace the other. MathFlow is simply there to make working with these respective power houses more fluid (hence ‚ÄúFlow‚Äù in the name).

SSM secure parameters work just as well in most situations (and would have been the way to do it until about 2018 when Secrets Manager came around) -- but one thorny aspect of SSM parameters is ensuring they're configured as secure parameters; if given access, developers **will** create standard non-encrypted parameters containing secrets and mitigating this risk is more trouble than it's worth compared to just using Secrets Manager for all secrets as a policy.  Technically SSM parameters are cheaper but at the scale where that cost is concerning, you might (depending on account structure) start to be concerned about quota limits for API calls which can grind all operations to a halt and even cascade into a big problem.

nehagz7,Davidhessler,aws,"I‚Äôve used AWS Security Incident Response a lot. It‚Äôs great.  Cost:  * How does pricing behave as security event volumes grow: Pricing is based on a percentage of the total spend across the organization instead of security events. This means as the number of event grow, your charges stay roughly the same * Are there unexpected charges or scaling limits compared to rolling your own Lambda/Step Functions orchestration: There‚Äôs only one charge. There are some [quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/securityir.html). The biggest is the number of active concurrent cases. The default is 50. This is adjustable.   Integration:  * How seamless is the integration with GuardDuty, CloudTrail, Security Hub, and other AWS security tools: GuardDuty and Security Hub integrate do not require additional configuration. * Any caveats on supported event types or workflow customization: This is feature dependent. AWS supported cases receive live support the Customer Incident Response Team. I have yet to find the limit of that team‚Äôs knowledge. Automated Triage supports all GuardDuty finding types and Security Hub works with select APN vendors. There‚Äôs also published integrations with [Jira and ServiceNow](https://github.com/aws-samples/sample-aws-security-incident-response-integrations) for case management.  Operational overhead:  * Is managing playbooks, custom response actions, and notifications straightforward, or does it require significant tuning and monitoring: it fairly straightforward. I would suggest you work with your account team for the initial on onboarding. The service learns about you and your patterns the more you use it.  They can help short cut that learning.  Benefits:  Beyond automation, have you seen measurable improvements in incident response time and security posture: yes. AWS has published stats on this. Your account team can get more as well.

Why couldn't you just have something subscribe to a Kafka topic that did all the necessary transformation and just cut out the s3 -> SNS -> SQS -> Redis part? Are these layers making data available in some way that is relevant and makes this linear path actually have branches? Is there deeper data enrichment that happens asynchrounously between the steps?  Even so, some simplification feels like it's in order.  >In other words, is it necessary to strictly follow the full architectural design for such low-change data,  There is absolutely no rule that says that all changes anywhere in your system have to go through all the same workflow steps.  Hard to say more without knowing more about your data, but configuration changes I'd imagine need to be timely applied and I can't imagine that asking them to hop between half a dozen systems before you know to do something is the fastest way to get that information to you.",1757961792.0

You have too many stacks for your web tier. Especially since you are using Fargate. There‚Äôs no need to break this out into several stacks. As a rule, if you have one construct in a stack you‚Äôve probably created too many stacks. Dependencies between Stacks will cause problems down the road and potentially lock up updates.  Do more inside a stack  2. Use the L3 construct [ApplicationLoadBalancedFargateService](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-cdk-lib.aws_ecs_patterns.ApplicationLoadBalancedFargateService.html).  3. Use the L3 construct [CDK Pipelines](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-cdk-lib.pipelines-readme.html) instead of creating a CodePipeline directly.   4. Write tests.

The fact is that with modern application development we all have pretty similar types of problems related to data, which are then solved via various combinations of tools like queues, databases, streams or whatever.

Running a lambda function to query a database 100 times per day is not crazy expensive.   What may cause problems is how long it takes to respond to those 100 API requests.

neartd9,kane_mx,aws,"Agreed.  NAT is a widely used method to resolve IP address conflicts by translating the source or destination IP addresses of network traffic.  * **Using AWS Private NAT Gateway**: This is a managed AWS service that allows resources in a VPC to communicate with other private networks without exposing them to the public internet.    * **How it works**: In each VPC with an overlapping CIDR, a secondary, non-overlapping CIDR block is added. A Private NAT Gateway is then deployed in a subnet within this new, unique CIDR range. When a resource in the original overlapping subnet needs to communicate with another overlapping VPC, its traffic is routed to the local Private NAT Gateway. The gateway performs Source NAT (SNAT), changing the source IP address to its own unique IP from the secondary range. Since the Transit Gateway now sees traffic coming from a unique, routable IP, it can forward the packet to the correct destination.    * **Benefits**: This is a highly recommended and scalable solution that integrates well with Transit Gateway.    * **Drawbacks**: It adds complexity to the network architecture and can introduce minor latency due to the translation process. * **Using a Custom NAT Instance**: Before the introduction of the Private NAT Gateway, a common solution was to deploy a custom NAT instance on an EC2 virtual machine. This involves manually configuring the instance to perform NAT, which offers more flexibility but requires self-management of high availability, patching, and performance.",1757913946.0

nejsj14,whatwilly0ubuild,MachineLearning,"Math reasoning is spot on and working at a company that solves tough engineering problems for startups, we use exactly this approach when clients want to prototype reasoning architectures without burning through their compute budget.  The key insight is you want domains where the reasoning patterns are complex but the knowledge base is constrained and well-defined. Math works because you can generate infinite training data programmatically and the rules are consistent.  Code debugging is another goldmine for this. Generate simple buggy functions and train the model to identify and fix them. You get multi-step reasoning, pattern matching, and logical deduction without needing world knowledge. Our clients have had success with this because code has clear correctness metrics and you can scale complexity gradually.  Logic puzzles are criminally underused for this. Things like knights and knaves problems, constraint satisfaction, or even simple syllogisms. The reasoning complexity can be arbitrarily high but the vocabulary stays tiny. You can generate thousands of these automatically and they force the model to maintain logical consistency across multiple steps.  Game state evaluation works really well too. Train on chess tactics or go life-and-death problems. The search space is huge but the rules are fixed and you can generate training data from existing game databases. The reasoning transfers surprisingly well to other domains.  Another approach we've seen work is causal reasoning tasks. Give the model simple scenarios with cause-and-effect relationships and train it to predict outcomes or identify causes. You can control for confounding variables and the logical structure mirrors real-world reasoning.  The thing about mathematical reasoning though is make sure you're testing actual reasoning and not just pattern memorization. Use out-of-distribution problems that require combining multiple learned concepts in novel ways.  Most teams try to jump straight to general reasoning and burn through compute on massive datasets when focused domain training would tell them if their architecture actually works.",1758040070.0
nejs3wg,whatwilly0ubuild,MachineLearning,"CSV files for hundreds of experiments is pure hell and at my job we help teams build out AI and ML systems so I've seen this exact pain point destroy productivity for months.  MLflow definitely isn't your only option and honestly it's overkill for a lot of use cases. If you're running solo or small team experiments, Weights and Biases is way more user friendly and their free tier handles thousands of runs. The visualization and comparison tools are actually usable unlike MLflow's clunky UI.  For something even lighter, try Neptune or Comet. Neptune has a really clean API and doesn't require you to restructure your entire training pipeline. You literally just add a few lines of logging code and you're tracking everything with proper versioning and comparison views.  But here's what I've learned from our clients who've scaled this successfully. The tool matters way less than your experiment naming conventions and metadata structure. Most teams just dump hyperparameters and metrics without thinking about searchability. You need consistent tagging for dataset versions, model architectures, preprocessing steps, and business objectives.  One approach that works really well is using a simple Python wrapper that automatically captures your environment state, git commit, data checksums, and system specs alongside your metrics. We've built this for customers and it prevents the ""I can't reproduce this result from three weeks ago"" problem.  If you want something dead simple, Tensorboard with proper directory structure can handle hundreds of experiments fine. Create folders like experiments/YYYY-MM-DD\_architecture\_dataset\_objective and log everything there. Add a simple Python script to parse the event files and generate comparison tables.  The reality is most off-the-shelf experiment tracking tools weren't built for your specific workflow, they're built for generalization. Sometimes a custom solution with good data discipline beats heavyweight platforms.  Just don't keep using CSV files, that's a disaster waiting to happen when you need to reproduce critical results six months from now.",1758039950.0
nejrq59,LatePiccolo8888,MachineLearning,"I‚Äôve been circling around the same frustration. The benchmarks feel like they‚Äôre measuring polish instead of depth. Almost like we‚Äôve optimized for synthetic plausibility rather than real semantic grounding.  One angle I‚Äôve been exploring is framing hallucination not just as factual error, but as a drift in meaning representation. A model can pass surface level correctness yet still erode the fidelity of the idea it‚Äôs supposed to carry. That‚Äôs why I think fidelity needs to be treated as its own eval axis.  I put together a short piece on this idea of *Semantic Drift vs Semantic Fidelity* if anyone here is interested in digging deeper: [https://zenodo.org/records/17037171](https://zenodo.org/records/17037171)  Would love to hear if others are experimenting with fidelity oriented metrics.",1758039840.0
nejriab,whatwilly0ubuild,MachineLearning,"Yeah, cancer classification is some of the nastiest ML work you can do and I work at an engineering consultancy where we've helped biotech teams tackle exactly this kind of biological heterogeneity problem.  The issue you're hitting is that cancer subtypes don't exist in clean feature space boundaries like most ML tutorials assume. SMOTE is basically useless here because it's interpolating between samples that might be fundamentally different even within the same class. You're right to ditch it.  For datasets like this, ensemble approaches with heavy feature engineering usually work better than trying to force traditional classifiers. Here's what we've seen work with our clients dealing with similar genomic and clinical data.  First, try hierarchical classification instead of flat multi-class. Build a tree where you first classify broad cancer families, then drill down to specific subtypes. This lets you capture the natural biological taxonomy and reduces the class overlap problem at each decision point.  Second, focus on feature selection that's biologically informed rather than purely statistical. Random Forest and XGBoost are great but they can latch onto noise correlations in high-dimensional biomedical data. Use domain knowledge to create feature groups, maybe pathway-based features or known biomarker panels, then let your ensemble methods work within those constrained spaces.  Third, consider a multi-task learning setup where you predict multiple related outcomes simultaneously. Maybe primary tumor site, grade, molecular subtype, treatment response. The shared representations often help with the individual classification tasks and can reduce overfitting to spurious correlations.  For the class imbalance, cost-sensitive learning with carefully tuned class weights often works better than synthetic sampling when you have this much overlap. You can also try focal loss variants that down-weight easy examples and focus learning on the hard boundary cases.  One thing that's worked really well for our customers is using uncertainty quantification. Train multiple models with bootstrap sampling and use prediction disagreement as a confidence measure. Cancer classification often benefits from knowing when the model isn't sure rather than forcing a prediction.  The reality is that some cancer subtypes might just not be distinguishable with your current feature set, and that's a biological reality not a modeling failure.",1758039775.0

nejr8ls,whatwilly0ubuild,MachineLearning,"That performance jump is definitely raising some red flags, and I'm working at a platform that designs ML-driven systems so we see this exact pattern when teams miss subtle evaluation issues.  The 6% gain from multimodal fusion isn't impossible but it's on the higher end of what you'd typically expect from simple concatenation, especially when your vision baseline is already hitting 92%. Here's what you need to check immediately.  First, make damn sure your validation split doesn't have any correlation between modalities that wouldn't exist in real deployment. Environmental scenes are tricky because if you're pulling satellite imagery and audio from the same geographic regions or time periods, you might have hidden correlations that make the fusion artificially effective. Our clients run into this constantly with geospatial data.  Second, check if your CLIP embeddings and ResNet18 features are similar dimensionally. If you're concatenating a 2048-dim vision vector with a 512-dim audio vector, the classifier might just be learning to weight the vision features heavier and the audio is just adding noise that happens to help with a few edge cases in your validation set.  The late fusion approach itself is fine as a baseline, but you're basically hoping the classifier learns good feature weighting. More robust approaches we've implemented include attention-based fusion where you let the model learn which modalities to focus on per sample, or even simple learned weighted averaging of the individual model predictions.  Here's what I'd do to validate this. Run your fused model on a completely held-out test set that wasn't involved in any hyperparameter tuning. If the performance drops significantly, you've got overfitting. Also try training the same fusion architecture but with randomly shuffled audio features paired with your vision features. If you still get good performance, your audio isn't actually contributing meaningful signal.  The other thing to watch is class distribution. Environmental scene classification often has imbalanced classes and if your fusion is just getting better at a few dominant classes while your individual modalities struggled with class imbalance, that could explain the jump.  Most teams try to duct tape these multimodal systems together without proper validation and it blows up during real deployment.",1758039697.0

Just because there's an overlap doesn't mean you need to treat the label as such. On the ensemble level it could be easier to manage.

Unfortunately, as is now frequent, I had to also take care of a number of papers outside of my own area of research (which is neither CV nor NLP), and so had to take reviewer points at face value, which limited the scope for my to try to champion papers I thought were hard done by.

nei9fbu,radarsat1,MachineLearning,"I mean when I'm just debugging I use some stupid name like wip123, but as soon as I have some results, I do go back, save & rename the interesting ones, and delete anything uninteresting.¬† There are also times when I want to keep the tensorboard logs but delete the checkpoints. It really depends what I'm doing.   Another habit is that if I'm doing some kind of hyperparameter search, I will have the training or validation script generate a report eg in json format. So in advance of a big run like that, I will write a report generator tool that reads these and generates some tables and plots -- for this I sometimes generate fake json files with results I might expect, just to have something to work with, then I delete these and generate the report with the real data.

The point of a review is to identify actual flaws in a study, not to write a book report on your personal takeaways.  What drives me crazy is how many reviewers subconsciously project their own research tastes and technical preferences onto the paper. Isn't that infuriating? This time, I used mean-pooling, and a reviewer listed it as a 'weakness' that I didn't 'try more diverse pooling methods.' That has absolutely nothing to do with my core paper, yet there it is in the weakness section. As an NLP researcher myself, I have no idea what a reviewer  is thinking when they point that out.

If you don‚Äôt plan early for how they‚Äôll interact with legacy systems, monitoring, identity / auth / security, the deployment gets messy. * **Cost overruns & FinOps discipline**: Inference, especially at scale, can surprise teams.

nehph00,fmeneguzzi,MachineLearning,"If it serves as any consolation, I'm an AC for AAAI, and got three out of five of my papers rejected in phase 1. All of them were, in my inescapably biased opinion, well written papers with good results (well, some reviewers obviously disagreed). As AC, I tried my best to read all reviews (even though the SPCs were supposed to have done that, and some did not), and essentially ignored reviews like the 3-liners you mentioned, sometimes overruling an SPC when I felt they just used the mathematical average of the reviews submitted to make their decision. I have taken note of the really poor reviewers, and I am pushing within AAAI to keep an institutional memory and never invite such reviewers again in the near future. In some cases, I have even told reviewers who did egregious things like put a list of papers they need to cite that were all papers from the reviewers themselves (citation farming).  Unfortunately, for some papers, if the reviews were obviously negative, and had at least substantive criticism, and the reviewers did not indicate a willingness to change their minds in phase 2, I had to make the call to reject a paper now because I found it better to free the paper to be resubmitted elsewhere than to lead the authors on knowing that the reviewers and SPC would still decide to reject later on.   At the end of the day, we will need to do something to limit the number of submissions (to clamp down on paper mills), and to entice people to get involved.",1758011758.0

The idea I am trying to convince people of is that (kind of like social credit) each paper must have at least one senior author (who presumably is capable of writing good-quality reviews) signed up as a reviewer, or if none are present, then you get one freebie (i.e. you as an author can participate in a single submission ""for free"" (and then you become senior and have to review). This senior author has to provide good quality reviews, or lose the right to submit for a year or two.  But there is obviously pushback. The argument against (which I hear again and again) is that, if you have a large group of students, then you need to pick ""which child you love more"" when deciding what to submit.

We would need to see how you work, how you approach problems and what your strengths and weaknesses are to be able to give you useful advice.  In broad strokes I'd say one thing that a lot of junior people run into when they first start working on ML in the industry is that people tend to massively underestimate the value of ops and software engineering fundamentals to a company in the real world. Research is important too, don't get me wrong, but at some point when you have a model that works as a Jupyter notebook on a small scale, you run into the necessity to deploy the thing in a way that the customers can actually use reliably and safely and at scale. That turns out to be far from trivial. Also managing data and all the infrastructure involved in that soon becomes more relevant than tinkering with your model architecture for most real world unsolved problems.  Now you may not choose the ops path for your own career and that's fine, but you would still benefit a great deal from taking engineering and ops seriously so that you can interface effectively with your teammates who do specialize in those areas and deliver value to your employer. That also can be a big career boost because you'll be one of the few who actually get ML solutions into production.",1758004965.0

This is much cheaper for everyone involved without any performance concerns.  So, if the client won't show you theirs, you build a contract with these protections and audit mechanisms and charge them a little extra tax for being difficult.  Even if you could distribute the weights encrypted, your model could easily be a teacher model and maybe be distilled, so the encryption may be a bigger false sense of security than a good contract.

That‚Äôs why I think we need to evaluate not only accuracy but semantic fidelity: how well a model preserves meaning across different levels of compression, retrieval, and reasoning.

nefh45j,Worried-Emotion-184,MachineLearning,"Let's take a simple example. Nothing fancy. Let's measure a system with 20 measurments but have no idea which of them actually are relevant or how they effect the output of the system. Let's call the output of the system ... Oil pressure   I could make a ML model of the predicted oil pressure based on thousands of sets of input data for training. But, if I applied some real physics, I would know that only 4 of the measurements actually have a significant influence. I would also know that oil pressure is correlated to pump speed by approximately (c1*speed)^c2, and influenced by oil temperature by sqrt(oil temp). -C1 and C2 are unknown constants that are a pain to figure out. The other 2 parameters (x, x2) have a 2nd order relationship with oil pressure. Y=c3 * x^2 +x And Y=C4 * x2^2 +x2   Now, if I design my ML code right, a simple reduced gradient solver or modified 1 layer nural network could solve for the 4 coefficients in the system with very little training data.¬† In fact, the ML code solution to the constants generates a single line equation to calculate predicted oil pressure.¬†¬†   I know this is a very basic example, some wouldn't even consider it ML. But it demonstrates how physics can help to reduce the complexity, cost, and training needs of some very complex problems by providing a framework to build a refined solution around.",1757976939.0
